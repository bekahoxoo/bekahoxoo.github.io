## Hello

This is me and some garlic bread.

## Education

I'm currently a PhD student under 
[Claudio Orlandi](http://www.cs.au.dk/~orlandi/) and [Ivan Damgård](http://www.daimi.au.dk/~ivan/). (They are both infinitely 
cooler than me.) I started in August 2017.

In its most succinct form, my education history looks like this:
- 2012 - 2015: BSc in mathematics at the University of Manchester,
- 2015 - 2016: MSc in infosec at UCL,
- 2017 - now: PhD in cryptography at Aarhus University.

My master's thesis was based on privacy in cryptocurrencies, and resulted in a paper on HD key management techniques and a paper introducing a ring signature mixer for ethereum. This included implementing Groth-Kohlweiss 
one out of many proofs and sublinear ring signatures ([here](https://github.com/rmercer93/gk-zerocoin)). It also led to learning about and implementing [other](https://github.com/rmercer93/p2prng) fun [things](https://github.com/rmercer93/BLS2) 
on ethereum and (quasi) Turing-complete blockchains in general, and led me to start supervising [my favourite intern](https://github.com/jakegsy/) 
for the Ethereum Foundation. We talk about random beacons a lot and try to see what is possible in a world of open and 
permissionless and public computation.

My introduction to programming began in the third year of my BSc when I started a Code First: Girls chapter in Manchester. It 
was here that I was taught by [@echesters](https://twitter.com/echesters) that you can have a serious career while also being a 
completely hilarious human. I thought I had mastered programming and so applied for an MSc at UCL and an incredibly generous 
scholarship to cover my entire MSc tuition fees. I miraculously was offered both and thought I'd conquered the world. Then I 
was introduced to asm and realised HTML isn't actually even a programming language, and I have been fully 
submerged in the world of computer science ever since :)


## Research

I mostly think about privacy, and especially executing/computing functions privately while in a fully adversarial environment 
(think dishonest majority and active adversaries, or alternatively a blockchain environment, or if you're feeling really 
pessimistic, the world).

## Teaching

I've taught the following:
- CFG beginners' web development - HTML/CSS, some JavaScript - at UCL (spring/summer 2017)
- CFG London general summer intensive - HTML/CSS/JavaScript/python (summer 2017)
- machine learning - at aarhus university (fall 2017)
