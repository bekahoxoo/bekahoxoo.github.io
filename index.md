## Hello

This is me and some garlic bread.

## Education

I'm currently a PhD student under [Claudio Orlandi](http://www.cs.au.dk/~orlandi/) and [Ivan Damgård](http://www.daimi.au.dk/~ivan/). I started in August 2017.

In its most succinct form, my education history looks like this:
- 2012 - 2015: BSc in mathematics at the University of Manchester,
- 2015 - 2016: MSc in infosec at UCL,
- 2017 - now: PhD in cryptography at Aarhus University.

### Fun facts, in reverse chronological order

- [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmVzRmBVzWk&t=17423s) is a talk I gave at MIT bitcoin expo.
- My master's thesis was based on privacy in cryptocurrencies. This led me to start 
supervising [my favourite intern](https://github.com/jakegsy/) for the Ethereum Foundation, and implementing 
[other](https://github.com/rmercer93/p2prng) fun [things](https://github.com/rmercer93/BLS2)
on ethereum.
- My introduction to programming began in the third year of my BSc when I started a CFG chapter in Manchester. It
was here I was taught by [@echesters](https://twitter.com/echesters) that you can have a serious career without being a serious human. I thought I'd mastered programming and so applied for an MSc at UCL, where I was then immediately introduced to malware analysis in assembly.
- My BSc transcript is pretty eclectic but I was somehow awarded an academic achievement scholarship every semester. My 
bachelor's project was on random number generation. I used an online C compiler, it was so much fun.
- I went to an all boys' school for my final year of high school, because my school didn't teach physics or 
further maths and I needed them to get into uni.

## Teaching

I've taught the following:
- CFG beginners' web development - HTML/CSS, some JavaScript - at UCL (spring/summer 2017)
- CFG London general summer intensive - HTML/CSS/JavaScript/python - at Google's Campus London (summer 2017)
- Machine Learning - at Aarhus University (fall 2017)

## Research

My published research includes the following:
- [Stealth Address and Key Management Techniques in Blockchain Systems](http://www.scitepress.org/DigitalLibrary/Link.aspx?doi=10.5220/0006270005590566) -  with Nicolas T. Courtois.
- [Poster: Towards Blockchain Transaction Privacy](https://www.clearmatics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IEEE-Presentation.pdf) - with Matthew Di Ferrante.
- [Möbius: Trustless Tumbling for Transaction Privacy](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/881) - with Sarah Meiklejohn.
