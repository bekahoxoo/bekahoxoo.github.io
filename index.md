## Hello

This is me and some garlic bread.

## Education

I'm currently a PhD student under [Claudio Orlandi](http://www.cs.au.dk/~orlandi/) and [Ivan Damgård](http://www.daimi.au.dk/~ivan/). I started in August 2017.

In its most succinct form, my education history looks like this:
- 2012 - 2015: BSc in mathematics at the University of Manchester,
- 2015 - 2016: MSc in infosec at UCL,
- 2017 - now: PhD in cryptography at Aarhus University.

### Misc bulletpoints (My education history in a less succinct form)

- [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmVzRmBVzWk&t=17423s) is a talk I gave at the 2018 MIT bitcoin expo. I also gave a similar (but longer) talk at Stanford's BPASE (also in 2018).
- My master's thesis was based on privacy in cryptocurrencies. This led me to start 
supervising [my favourite ever intern](https://github.com/jakegsy/) for the Ethereum Foundation.
- My introduction to programming began in the third year of my BSc when I started a [CFG](https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/) chapter in Manchester. It
was here I was taught by [@echesters](https://twitter.com/echesters) that you can have a serious career without being a serious human. I thought I'd mastered programming and so applied for an MSc at UCL, where I was then immediately introduced to malware analysis in assembly. Someone put me in vi (not vim!!!) and I spent the whole 2 hours trying to delete backspace characters by hitting backspace.
- My BSc transcript is pretty eclectic but I was somehow awarded an academic achievement scholarship every semester. My 
bachelor's project was on random number generation and statistical analysis of 'random' 'strings'. I used an online C compiler on the university windows machines and copy pasted my C code from word??? (I had no clue how else to write and compile my code??), it was so much fun!
- I went to an all boys' school for my final year of high school, because my school didn't teach physics or 
further maths and I needed them to get into uni (also for enjoyment of life???). I can't even remember how many times I was asked to leave the premises (lol)

## Teaching

I've taught the following:
- CFG beginners' web development - HTML/CSS, some JavaScript - UCL, spring/summer 2017
- CFG London general summer intensive - HTML/CSS/JavaScript/python - Google's Campus London, summer 2017
- Machine Learning - Aarhus University, fall 2017
- Distributed systems and Security (x2) - Aarhus University, fall 2018
