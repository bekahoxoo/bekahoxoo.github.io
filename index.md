## education

I'm currently a PhD student at aarhus university, and I started in august 2017, under Claudio Orlandi and Ivan Damg√•rd.

In its most succinct form, my education history looks like this:
- BSc in mathematics from the University of Manchester,
- MSc in infosec from UCL.

My thesis was based on privacy in cryptocurrencies, and resulted in a paper on stealth address key management techniques and
another paper introducing a ring signature mixer for ethereum, which also included implementing Groth-Kohlweiss one out of 
many proofs and sublinear ring signatures. It also led to me learning about and then implementing other things on Ethereum 
and (quasi) Turing-complete blockchains in general, and led to me supervising [my favourite intern](https://github.com/jakegsy/) 
for the Ethereum Foundation. We talk about random beacons a lot and try to see what is possible in a world of open and 
permissionless and public computation.

My introduction to programming began in the third year of my BSc when I started a Code First: Girls chapter in Manchester. It 
was here that I was taught by [@echesters](https://twitter.com/echesters) that you can have a serious career while also being a 
completely hilarious human.


## research interests

I mostly think about privacy, and especially executing/computing functions privately while in a fully adversarial environment 
(think dishonest majority and active adversaries, or alternatively a blockchain environment, or if you're feeling really 
pessimistic, the world). 


## teaching

I've taught the following:
- CFG beginners' web development - HTML/CSS, some JavaScript - at UCL (spring/summer 2017)
- CFG London general summer intensive - HTML/CSS/JavaScript/python (summer 2017)
- machine learning - at aarhus university (fall 2017)
